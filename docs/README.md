## What is DNA-Lang?

DNA-Lang is a revolutionary programming language that models software as living organisms. Each program is an autonomous digital organism that can evolve, adapt, and self-manage its infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform.

### Key Features

- **Genomic Programming Model**: Code is structured as DNA with genes, mutations, and evolutionary processes
- **Autonomous Infrastructure**: Programs self-provision and manage their own cloud resources
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Systems improve and adapt over time based on environmental feedback
- **Bio-Digital Twins**: Create living digital representations of complex systems
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Intelligent agents manage different aspects of the organism
