# DNA-Lang Media Pitching Strategy and Guidelines

## Strategic Media Outreach Framework

---

## Overview

This document outlines DNA-Lang's strategic approach to media pitching, including personalization techniques, follow-up sequences, relationship building strategies, and success metrics.

---

## Core Pitching Principles

### 1. Research Before Reaching Out

**Journalist Research Checklist**:
- [ ] Review last 10 articles written by journalist
- [ ] Identify their beat and coverage areas
- [ ] Note their writing style and tone
- [ ] Check their social media activity (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Identify gaps in their recent coverage
- [ ] Find personal interests or specialties

**Publication Research**:
- [ ] Understand editorial calendar and themes
- [ ] Review recent coverage of similar topics
- [ ] Identify competitive coverage gaps
- [ ] Note preferred article formats and lengths
- [ ] Review submission guidelines

### 2. Personalization is Key

**Never Send Generic Pitches**:
❌ "I thought you might be interested in our quantum computing platform..."  
✅ "Your recent article on IBM's quantum roadmap mentioned the need for production-ready quantum applications. DNA-Lang just validated the first quantum consciousness platform with 99% fidelity on IBM hardware..."

**Personalization Elements**:
- Reference specific recent article
- Connect to their beat/interests
- Explain why NOW is the right time
- Offer exclusive angle or access
- Show familiarity with their work

### 3. Lead with Value, Not Features

**Features vs. Benefits**:
❌ "DNA-Lang has achieved 99% consciousness fidelity with p < 0.001"  
✅ "For the first time, software can truly evolve itself using quantum computing - validated by independent labs with 99.9% statistical confidence"

**Value Propositions by Publication Type**:

**Tech Media**: Innovation, disruption, future impact  
**Business Media**: ROI, cost savings, competitive advantage  
**Scientific Media**: Methodology, validation, reproducibility  
**Industry Media**: Practical applications, case studies, best practices
