# GCP Organization Structure for DNA-Lang Platform

This folder structure enforces organizational policies, manages access control at scale, and logically organizes resources for the DNA-Lang genomic analysis platform.

## Folder Structure

### Environment Segregation
- `environments/prod/` - Production environment with strict security controls
- `environments/staging/` - Staging environment for pre-production testing
- `environments/dev/` - Development environment for active development

### Resource Organization
- `iam-policies/` - Access control and identity management policies
- `resource-policies/` - GCP resource organization policies
- `security-controls/` - Environment-specific security configurations
- `terraform/` - Infrastructure as Code for each environment

## Security Model

### Production Environment
- Strict access controls with multi-factor authentication
- Enhanced monitoring and logging
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Network isolation and VPC controls
- Backup and disaster recovery policies

### Non-Production Environments
- Relaxed access for development teams
- Limited data access (synthetic/anonymized data only)
- Cost optimization controls
- Automated testing pipelines

## Access Control Strategy

The organization structure prevents unauthorized access between environments through:
1. Environment-specific service accounts
2. IAM policies with least privilege access
3. Resource-level permissions
4. Project-level isolation
5. Network segmentation
