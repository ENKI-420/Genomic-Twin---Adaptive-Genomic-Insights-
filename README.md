# Genomic Twin - Adaptive Genomic Insights Platform

An AI-powered platform for oncology, offering tools for mutation analysis, digital twin simulations, CRISPR feasibility, and more.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the web server
python3 server.py
# Visit http://localhost:8000

# OR start Streamlit development server
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:8501
```

### Deployment

This platform is ready for deployment on multiple platforms:
